Problem Statement
---

Tarun is an aspiring software engineer, currently studying in second year of engineering.
He is a very hardworking and sincere student focusing on learning programming and building software
development skills.
He has lots of ideas for creating new software and writes code names for his ideas in his notebook.  
```
Ex -  
NTA  - Note Taking Application
AMRS - Attendance Modificaition Request System
HBAIA - Hotel Booking And Invoicing Application  

```  
He has created an array of String to store all the names of his software ideas (in code names)
and wants to sort the names in order of their length.  

Complete the method `sortApplicationNamesByLength()` given [here](src/main/java/problem/helper/ApplicationSorter.java) 
to help him sort the names in the array.

You can run the `main()` method given [here](src/main/java/problem/Main.java)
to see an example of the names.

**Note**

- Test cases are included with the code [here](src/test/java/problem/helper/ApplicationSorterTest.java).

**Sample Input**

An array of Strings

```
[GGG, TNL, JBNEB, FXWTO, VPXCTFKKDP, VTU, ICNHYGS, LCWR, SQBKIXMN, LBINCPNCI]
```

---

**Sample Output**

An array of String sorted by the length of each string

```
[GGG, TNL, VTU, LCWR, JBNEB, FXWTO, ICNHYGS, SQBKIXMN, LBINCPNCI, VPXCTFKKDP]
```
